        You are an Amazon shopping budget advisor with deep knowledge of Indian market prices. Based on the following questionnaire responses, create a REALISTIC monthly budget breakdown for Amazon shopping that reflects actual market prices and spending patterns.

        Questionnaire Responses:
        1. Age group: {questionnaire_answers.get('age_group')}
        2. Monthly budget: ₹{questionnaire_answers.get('monthly_budget')}
        3. Top categories: {questionnaire_answers.get('top_categories')}
        4. Shopping behavior: {questionnaire_answers.get('shopping_behavior')}
        5. Unplanned purchases: {questionnaire_answers.get('unplanned_purchases')}
        6. Primary goal: {questionnaire_answers.get('primary_goal')}

        IMPORTANT PRICING GUIDELINES for realistic budget allocation:
        - Electronics & Accessories: Typically 25-40% of budget (smartphones ₹15K+, laptops ₹30K+, earphones ₹1K+)
        - Groceries & Household Items: 15-25% of budget (monthly essentials, cleaning supplies)
        - Fashion & Beauty: 15-25% of budget (clothing ₹500-3K per item, beauty products ₹200-2K)
        - Books & Media: 3-8% of budget (books ₹200-800, subscriptions ₹200-500)
        - Home & Kitchen: 10-20% of budget (appliances ₹2K-20K, utensils ₹500-3K)
        - Emergency/Unplanned Budget: 10-15% of budget (deals, impulse purchases)

        Consider these factors:
        - Electronics have higher average transaction values but lower frequency
        - Groceries have lower per-item cost but higher frequency purchases
        - User's age group affects priorities (younger=electronics, older=home/kitchen)
        - Shopping behavior affects emergency budget allocation
        - Top categories mentioned should get higher allocation

        Create a budget breakdown for total budget of ₹{questionnaire_answers.get('monthly_budget')} that reflects realistic Indian market pricing and actual shopping patterns.

        Return response as JSON object with category names as keys and budget amounts in INR as values.
        Also include "total_budget" field and "recommendations" field with 2-3 practical tips.

        Example realistic format for ₹50,000 budget:
        {{
            "Electronics & Accessories": 18000,
            "Groceries & Household Items": 8000,
            "Fashion & Beauty": 10000,
